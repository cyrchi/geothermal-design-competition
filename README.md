We developed this interactive web mapping application as a submission to the <a href="https://inl.gov/geothermalchallenge/">2020 Geothermal Design Competition</a> from the US Department of Energy through the Idaho National Laboratory. We are currently students in a Masters of Geospatial Information Science program.

This application uses data from the <a href="https://gdr.openei.org/api?action=getSubmissionsWithPermissionsForUser&s=all&format=json"  target="blank">Geothermal Data Repository</a> and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(<a href="https://maps.nrel.gov/geothermal-prospector/?aL=0&bL=clight&cE=0&lR=0&mC=37.23032838760387%2C-95.8447265625&zL=4"  target="blank">1</a>,<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/gis/geothermal.html" target="blank">2</a>), and the submission contains two main components:
<ol>
<li>An introductory <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~eread781/Geothermal/index.html" target="blank">website</a>, and </li>
<li>A <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~eread781/Geothermal/application.html" target="blank">web mapping application</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Challenge Question</h2>

Geothermal energy is difficult to understand because it is located underground. How can geospatial mapping increase our understanding of this important renewable energy resource? How can GIS improve how we visualize and communicate about geothermal energy? Create a map (digital interactive or static) showing how GIS could portray or enhance the communication of geothermal technology.

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Advance Geothermal Energy:</b>We want this tool to accelerate research and development of geothermal resources in the US. Geothermal energy is a renewable energy resource with a lot of untapped potential, which this tool can help unlock.</li>
<li><b>Improve Access to Research:</b>The Geothermal Data Repository is a great way to share information. But, we think it can be better. With this tool, you can visualize research by location and use multiple filter options to hone in on the information you need.</li>
<li><b>Identify Research Potential:</b>By mapping submissions to the Geothermal Data Repository with a few other important variables—like Enhanced Geothermal favorability across the US—this tool helps you see where more research might have a big impact.</li>
</ol>
