<h1>
  How did we make the map?
</h1>
<p>
    To review the code behind our project, check out the <a href= "https://github.com/cyrchi/geothermal-design-competition"target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The following is a brief overview of how our project fits together:
</p>
<p>
    First, we accessed the <a href= "https://gdr.openei.org/api?action=getSubmissionsWithPermissionsForUser&s=all&format=json"target="_blank">raw metadata</a> from the Geothermal Data Repository (GDR) in JSON format. Using a Python script, we extracted the information we needed from the metadata, and used ArcGIS Pro to turn it into a feature class and do the analysis necessary to create the Research Impact Potential data. We added these two data layers, as well as the “Deep Enhanced Geothermal Potential” layer from National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s <a href= "https://maps.nrel.gov/geothermal-prospector/?aL=0&bL=clight&cE=0&lR=0&mC=35.06597313798418%2C-96.1962890625&zL=4"target="_blank">Geothermal Prospector</a>, to ArcGIS Online as hosted feature layers. Once securing the data for our map, we went to work on creating our web page and interactive GIS application. We custom-built both the web page, starting from a Bootstrap template, and the GIS application, using the ArcGIS API for Javascript 4.14. 
</p>
<p>
    A few things require a more detailed explanation:
</p>
<h3>
1. Topic Filters
</h3>
<p>
    In the map, you can filter the GDR submissions using a few predefined filters. These filters work by querying the ArcGIS Online hosted feature layer of GDR submissions using SQL. For the Direct Use, EGS, FORGE, and Hydrothermal features, we created new fields in the GDR submission data. We calculated each field to equal “TRUE” if either the “submission_name” or “keywords'' fields contained the relevant category or some variation thereof. For instance, in the “egs” field of the GDR submission data, if the “submission_name” or “keywords'' fields for a record contained “egs”, “enhanced”, or “enhanced geothermal”, the “egs” field for that record would equal “TRUE”. If it did not contain any of those strings, it would equal “FALSE”.
</p>
<table style="width:70%">
    <tr>
      <th>Filter</th>
      <th>SQL Statement (after WHERE)</th> 
      <th>Explanation</th>

<h3>
  2. Research Impact Potential
</h3>
<p>
    We did our own analysis to create the Research Impact Potential data layer, available in the map. Research Impact Potential is represented by an index, calculated using several other sources of data. First, we created a hexagon tessellation to cover the continental US. Each hex in the grid covers an area of 2500 square miles. Then we calculated the index to each hex. The calculation of the index and classification of the component data layers are shown below.
</p>
<p>
Research Impact Potential = 
0.35 * (EGS_Potential) + 0.35 * (GDR_Submissions) + 0.15 * (Operating_Geothermal_Stations) + 0.15 * (Developing_Geothermal_Stations)
